# a-puzzle-a-day

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/leonzdev/a-puzzle-a-day)

This app is created using Bolt.dev

# Notes
* Bolt.dev created a working website with the current layout in 1 shot. All I asked was "create a webapp for the game a-puzzle-a-day". Very impressive!
* Asked it to add functions such as remove and rotate pieces. Both done with a few shots.
* Hitting a weird bug that when I asked it to add `rotate` it always generate an incomplete tsx souorce file. Changed my propmt multiple times but every time it missed a close tag for a div.
* Ran out of free tokens just after the game is playable.
* Fixed minor bugs and styling issues with help from ChatGPT O1.
* Maybe I will ask ChatGPT to add further functions such as a solver or a date picker.

# Impression of bolt.dev
* 1-shot working app is impressive
* However, code is done in a hacky style:
  * Hardcodings
  * Repetitions
  * A lot of in-line components creating a lot of coupling. Not easy for a human dev to browse and make manual changes. This is my main complain and concern of bolt.dev
* Too few free tokens
